  - ...The only time Oates talked about herself was to express regret about how much time she had been wasting lately.

    “Minutes!” Mailman joked. “We’re talking about minutes—wasted.”

    She was teaching two classes (one at Princeton, another at Rutgers); had just finished a new novel, called “Butcher,” which will be published this spring; and had already sent a draft of her next novel to her agent. “Sometimes I can’t get out of bed,” she said. “I’m thinking about something—and then I’m doing this and I’m doing that, and I’m not working. I’m thinking about working.”

    “But that is working,” Mann said.

    “But most of the time I’m wasting time,” Oates said. “And so all I can figure is that other people waste more time. That’s all.”

    To make up for lost time earlier in the day, she said, she’d probably stay up until 1:30 a.m. writing.
